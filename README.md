# NamingVariationsCSharp

This code is based off of a HackerRank challenge. The initial commit was the initial code I wrote to complete the challenge. The subsequent commits is the refactored code using SOLID principles in an effert to better understand those principles and put them into practice.

Input Format:

Each line of the input file will begin with an operation (S or C) followed by a semi-colon followed by M, C, or V followed by a semi-colon followed by the words you'll need to operate on. The operation will either be S (split) or C (combine) M indicates method, C indicates class, and V indicates variable In the case of a split operation, the words will be a camel case method, class or variable name that you need to split into a space-delimited list of words starting with a lowercase letter. In the case of a combine operation, the words will be a space-delimited list of words starting with lowercase letters that you need to combine into the appropriate camel case String. Methods should end with an empty set of parentheses to differentiate them from variable names.

Output Format:

For each input line, your program should print either the space-delimited list of words (in the case of a split operation) or the appropriate camel case string (in the case of a combine operation).
